# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with GitHub workflows (branches, pull requests, issues, projects, permissions)
- Access to the relevant GitHub repository with appropriate permissions
- Team members onboarded with basic Git and GitHub knowledge
- CI/CD tools (optional depending on workflow)

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches

1. **Keep feature branches short-lived.**  
   Merge them back into the main branch within a few days.
2. **Write descriptive commit messages.**  
   Use GitHub Copilot to assist in clarity and conciseness.
3. **Regularly incorporate changes from main branch.**  
   Sync feature branches frequently to minimize divergence and conflicts.
4. **Foster open communication.**  
   Collaborate with teammates, using tools like Microsoft Teams to resolve merge conflicts.
5. **Use GitHub Issues to track work.**  
   Link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.
6. **Leverage GitHub Projects for release planning.**  
   Track progress and ensure all work is completed before releasing.
7. **Apply branch naming conventions:**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
   - Feature branches: `feature/<description>`
   - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<description>`
   - Release branches: `release/<version-number>`
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<description>`
8. **Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases and tags.**
   - Tag format: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

### Code Review Best Practices

1. **Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations.**
2. **Use pull requests for code reviews.**
3. **Assign reviewers based on expertise and codebase knowledge.**
4. **Provide constructive feedback and improvement suggestions.**
5. **Focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to standards.**
6. **Encourage open discussion and collaboration.**
7. **Utilize GitHub review features (inline comments, review requests).**
8. **Ensure all requested changes are made before merging.**
9. **Foster a positive and supportive code review culture.**

### Repository Audits and Access Reviews

1. **Review repository settings regularly.**  
   Ensure alignment with organizational security policies.
2. **Audit access permissions for users and teams.**  
   Apply the principle of least privilege.
3. **Identify and remove access for inactive/departed members.**
4. **Review and manage external collaborator permissions.**
5. **Rotate credentials frequently (tokens/SSH keys).**
6. **Monitor GitHub audit logs for suspicious activities.**
7. **Use automated tools/scripts for auditing.**

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

1. **Maintain a comprehensive README file in each repository.**  
   Update as project evolves.
2. **Encourage clear code comments and module/function documentation.**
3. **Utilize GitHub Wiki or an external knowledge base for guides and tutorials.**  
   Regularly update with contributions from team members.
4. **Create and maintain architecture/design documentation.**
5. **Develop onboarding materials (guides, checklists, tutorials).**
6. **Use code reviews and pair programming for mentorship/knowledge sharing.**
7. **Leverage communication tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for collaboration and sharing.**
8. **Conduct documentation sprints to keep docs up-to-date.**

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Always follow your organization's security guidelines when managing access and auditing repositories.
- Ensure sensitive credentials are rotated and never committed to the repository.
- Regular documentation sprints are optional but recommended for comprehensive documentation.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A branching strategy that keeps changes close to the main branch, improving collaboration and release stability.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Versioning standard (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) that communicates compatibility and scope of changes.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limiting user and service permissions to the minimum necessary for their work.
- **Pull Request:** GitHub mechanism for proposing, reviewing, and merging code changes.
- **Code Review:** Process of examining code changes to maintain quality and share knowledge.
- **GitHub Issues/Projects/Wiki:** Built-in tools for tracking work, planning releases, and maintaining documentation.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub feature for tracking repository activity and security events.
