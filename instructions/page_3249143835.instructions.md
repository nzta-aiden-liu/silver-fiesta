# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository
- Team members with appropriate permissions
- Familiarity with GitHub features: branches, pull requests, issues, projects, audit logs

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Optimize Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches:**
   1. Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge back to main within a few days.
   2. Write descriptive and clear commit messages. Use GitHub Copilot where appropriate.
   3. Regularly merge changes from the main branch into feature branches to reduce conflicts.
   4. Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Link pull requests to relevant issues.
   5. Plan and track release progress using GitHub Projects.
   6. Apply branch naming conventions:
      - Use lowercase and hyphens.
      - Feature branches: `feature/<description>`
      - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<description>`
      - Release branches: `release/<version number>`
      - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<description>`
   7. Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for release versioning and tagging.
   8. Tag release branches using:  
      ```
      git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
      ```
2. **Code Review Best Practices:**
   1. Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations.
   2. Use pull requests as the main code review mechanism.
   3. Assign reviewers based on relevant team expertise.
   4. Provide constructive feedback, focusing on code quality, readability, and standards.
   5. Use GitHub’s code review tools, like inline comments and review requests.
   6. Ensure all necessary changes are completed before merging pull requests.
   7. Foster a positive and collaborative review culture.
3. **Conduct Regular Repository Audits and Access Reviews:**
   1. Review repository settings to match security policies and best practices.
   2. Validate access permissions; follow the principle of least privilege.
   3. Identify and revoke access for inactive/departed users.
   4. Audit external collaborator permissions, limiting scope and duration.
   5. Rotate/update credentials (tokens, SSH keys) regularly.
   6. Use the GitHub Audit Log to monitor suspicious or security events.
   7. Employ automated tools for auditing where feasible.
4. **Document and Share Knowledge in the Dev Team:**
   1. Maintain an up-to-date README with clear overview, installation, and usage instructions.
   2. Write clear and concise code comments and documentation.
   3. Use GitHub’s wiki or external knowledge base for detailed guides and tutorials.
   4. Create and maintain architecture/design documentation.
   5. Prepare onboarding materials, including environment setup and coding standards.
   6. Conduct code reviews and pair programming for mentorship and knowledge sharing.
   7. Use collaboration tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for ongoing team communication.
   8. Periodically run documentation sprints to update and improve project docs.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Ensure that all access and credential management actions comply with your organization's internal security policies.
- Regularly review documentation for updates as your project evolves.
- Fostering a supportive code review culture leads to better collaboration and code quality.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A development approach where most work happens on a single main branch, with short-lived feature branches.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Standard format for software versions (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), communicating the nature of changes.
- **Pull Request:** GitHub feature for proposing, reviewing, and merging changes into a codebase.
- **GitHub Issues and Projects:** Tools for tracking work, bugs, and planning releases.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub’s logging feature for tracking critical actions and security events in a repository.
- **Code Review:** A process for ensuring code quality and sharing knowledge among team members.
