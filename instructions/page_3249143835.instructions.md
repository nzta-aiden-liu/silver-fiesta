# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Access to a GitHub repository
- Familiarity with trunk-based development and release branching strategies
- Permissions to manage branches, pull requests, and repository settings

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Keep Feature Branches Short-Lived**
   - Create feature branches only for short-term work.
   - Aim to merge feature branches into the main branch within a few days.

2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Use clear messages explaining the purpose and intent of every change.
   - Utilize GitHub Copilot to help write concise commit descriptions.

3. **Regularly Sync With Main Branch**
   - Frequently pull changes from main into your feature branch to minimize conflicts.

4. **Foster Communication for Merge Conflicts**
   - Coordinate with teammates using communication tools (like Microsoft Teams) to resolve conflicts.

5. **Track Work Using GitHub Issues**
   - Create Issues for tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
   - Link Pull Requests to related Issues for context and traceability.

6. **Plan with GitHub Projects**
   - Use Projects to plan releases and track progress, ensuring all necessary tasks are completed pre-release.

7. **Adopt Branch Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
   - Name branches:
     - `feature/description` for new features
     - `bugfix/description` for bug fixes
     - `release/x.y.z` for releases
     - `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes

8. **Use Semantic Versioning for Releases**
   - Tag releases using SemVer:  
     ```
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
     ```

9. **Implement Code Review Guidelines**
   - Set clear code review expectations for your team.
   - Use pull requests as the main mechanism for code reviews.
   - Assign reviewers based on expertise.
   - Provide constructive feedback and adhere to coding standards.
   - Use GitHub's code review tools (inline comments, requests).
   - Merge only after applying all necessary changes.

10. **Conduct Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews**
    - Review repository settings against organizational policies.
    - Validate access permissions, adhering to least privilege.
    - Remove access for inactive/departed users.
    - Limit permissions for external collaborators.
    - Rotate credentials and SSH keys regularly.
    - Use GitHub’s audit log to monitor repository activity.
    - Employ automation where possible for audits.

11. **Document and Share Knowledge**
    - Maintain updated README files in each repository.
    - Write clear code comments and documentation.
    - Use GitHub Wiki or external platforms for detailed docs.
    - Maintain system architecture and design documents.
    - Prepare onboarding materials for new team members.
    - Share knowledge through code reviews and pair programming.
    - Use team communication platforms (Slack, Teams) for discussion.
    - Organize documentation sprints to keep docs current.

## Warnings or Important Notes
- Ensure permissions follow the principle of least privilege to reduce security risks.
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity.
- Keep documentation and onboarding processes up to date.
- Clean up obsolete or stale branches to maintain repository health.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A source control workflow where all developers work in short-lived branches and frequently merge changes into the main branch to avoid long-lived divergence.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning system (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) that communicates release scope and compatibility.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A mechanism for reviewing and merging changes from one branch into another, typically involving code review.
- **Least Privilege**: Security principle where users have the minimum level of access required to perform their work.
- **Documentation Sprint**: Scheduled time dedicated to updating and improving project documentation collectively.
