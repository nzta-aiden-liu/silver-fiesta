# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Access to the GitHub EMU platform and repositories.
- Basic understanding of Git, branching strategies, and permissions.
- Familiarity with GitHub features such as Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, and Wikis.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches

1. **Keep feature branches short-lived.**  
   Aim to merge them back into the main branch within a few days.

2. **Write descriptive commit messages.**  
   Clearly convey the purpose and intent of changes. Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing clear messages.

3. **Regularly update feature branches.**  
   Incorporate changes from the main branch to minimize divergence and conflicts.

4. **Foster open communication and collaboration.**  
   Resolve merge conflicts with teammates using integrated tools like Microsoft Teams.

5. **Utilize GitHub Issues.**  
   Track tasks, bugs, and feature requests, and link pull requests to relevant issues for context.

6. **Leverage GitHub Projects.**  
   Plan and track release progress to ensure completion before release.

7. **Use branch naming conventions.**  
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
   - Start feature branches with `feature/`, bugfix branches with `bugfix/`, release branches with `release/`, and hotfix branches with `hotfix/`.

8. **Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.**  
   Tag release branches using:  
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`

### Implementing Code Review Best Practices

1. Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations.
2. Use pull requests as the primary mechanism for reviews.
3. Assign reviewers based on expertise and familiarity with the codebase.
4. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
5. Focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to coding standards.
6. Encourage open discussion and collaboration during reviews.
7. Use GitHub features like inline comments and review requests.
8. Ensure all review feedback is addressed before merging.
9. Foster a positive and supportive code review culture.

### Conducting Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews

1. Periodically review repository settings for compliance with security policies.
2. Validate and review individual and team access permissions; follow least privilege.
3. Identify and remove access for inactive or departed team members.
4. Review and manage external collaborator permissions; restrict scope and duration.
5. Regularly rotate credentials (access tokens, SSH keys).
6. Monitor GitHub’s audit logs for suspicious activity or security events.
7. Consider using automated tools/scripts for audit and issue identification.

### Documenting and Sharing Knowledge

1. Maintain comprehensive README files with project overview, instructions, and guidelines.
2. Write clear code comments and documentation for complex logic and high-level components.
3. Utilize GitHub Wiki or an external knowledge base for detailed guides and tutorials.
4. Create and update architecture/design documents describing system components and decisions.
5. Develop onboarding materials (guides, tutorials, checklists) for new team members.
6. Use code reviews and pair programming for knowledge sharing and mentorship.
7. Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for ongoing knowledge sharing.
8. Conduct documentation sprints to periodically update and improve project documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Regularly updating branches and reviewing access permissions reduces conflict and security risks.
- Tagging releases with proper semantic versions is essential for clear communication.
- Always address all code review feedback before merging pull requests.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A branching strategy emphasizing frequent merging into a central branch, minimizing long-lived branches.
- **Release Branches:** Branches dedicated to preparing stable releases, often versioned and tagged.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** A versioning scheme using `major.minor.patch` to communicate changes and compatibility.
- **Least Privilege:** Security principle of granting users the minimum access needed to perform their tasks.
- **Code Review:** Process in which peers evaluate code for quality, readability, and correctness before merging.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub feature for tracking repository events and permissions changes, used for monitoring and security.
- **Documentation Sprint:** Focused effort by the team to update and improve documentation within a set period.
