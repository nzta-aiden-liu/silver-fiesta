# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Git, GitHub, and basic branching workflows.
- Access to GitHub repositories and permissions to manage branches, issues, and pull requests.
- Communication tools integration (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) for collaboration.
- Understanding of semantic versioning (SemVer).

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches**
   1.1. Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge them back into the main branch within a few days.
   1.2. Write descriptive commit messages that clearly convey the purpose and intent of changes. Use GitHub Copilot to assist in writing clear and concise commit messages.
   1.3. Regularly merge changes from the main branch into feature branches to reduce divergence and conflicts.
   1.4. Foster open communication and collaborate with teammates to resolve merge conflicts. Use GitHub's integration with Microsoft Teams to facilitate collaboration.
   1.5. Utilize GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.
   1.6. Use GitHub Projects to plan and track the progress of your releases.
   1.7. Adopt branch naming conventions:
       - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
       - Feature branches: `feature/<brief-description>`
       - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/<brief-description>`
       - Release branches: `release/<version-number>`
       - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<brief-description>`
   1.8. Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for release versioning and tagging.
   1.9. Tag release branches with the SemVer version:  
       `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

2. **Implementing Code Review Best Practices**
   2.1. Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations for your team.
   2.2. Use pull requests for code reviews.
   2.3. Assign reviewers based on expertise and familiarity with the codebase.
   2.4. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.
   2.5. Focus on code quality, readability, and coding standards.
   2.6. Encourage open discussion and collaboration.
   2.7. Utilize GitHub code review tools (inline comments, review requests).
   2.8. Ensure necessary changes are made before merging.
   2.9. Foster a positive, supportive review culture.

3. **Conducting Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews**
   3.1. Periodically review repository settings for security compliance.
   3.2. Review and validate access permissions; follow the principle of least privilege.
   3.3. Identify and remove access for inactive or departed users.
   3.4. Review and limit external collaborator permissions.
   3.5. Regularly rotate credentials (tokens, SSH keys).
   3.6. Monitor GitHub’s audit log for suspicious activities.
   3.7. Use automated tools/scripts for auditing.
   3.8. Refer to GitHub Documentation for auditing:  
       [Reviewing Your Organization's Audit Log](https://docs.github.com/en/github-audit-log/reviewing-your-organizations-audit-log)

4. **Documenting and Sharing Knowledge Within the Dev Team**
   4.1. Maintain comprehensive README files with project overview, setup, and usage guidelines.
   4.2. Encourage clear, concise code comments and module documentation.
   4.3. Use GitHub Wiki or external knowledge bases for detailed guides and tutorials.
   4.4. Create and maintain architecture and design documents.
   4.5. Develop onboarding materials (guides, checklists, environment setup info).
   4.6. Promote knowledge sharing via code reviews and pair programming.
   4.7. Use communication tools (Slack, Teams) for ongoing discussions and knowledge exchange.
   4.8. Conduct documentation sprints to update and improve project documentation (optional).

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Ensure branch naming conventions and commit messages are followed for clarity and traceability.
- Audit and update repository access regularly to maintain security.
- Keep documentation current to avoid onboarding bottlenecks.
- Use only the permissions necessary for each collaborator to adhere to least privilege principles.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-based Development**: A workflow where most changes are merged into a single main branch quickly, reducing long-lived branches and minimizing integration issues.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning scheme using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, communicating the impact and compatibility of releases.
- **Code Review**: The process of evaluating code changes before merging to maintain quality and encourage knowledge sharing.
- **Branch Naming Convention**: Structured naming for branches to improve organization and clarity in the repository.
- **Least Privilege**: Security practice of granting only the permissions required for a user or collaborator to perform their responsibilities.
- **Repository Audit Log**: A record of key events and changes in the repository, used for monitoring and investigation.
- **Documentation Sprint**: A focused effort for a team to update and improve documentation in a short period.
