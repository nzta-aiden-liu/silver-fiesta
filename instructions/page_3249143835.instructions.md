# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Access to the GitHub EMU platform and repositories.
- Membership or collaborator status in your organization's GitHub repositories.
- Familiarity with Git, GitHub features (Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, Wiki, Audit Log).
- Integrated collaboration tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) if required.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-based Development and Release Branches

1. **Keep Feature Branches Short-lived**
   - Ensure feature branches are merged back into the main branch within a few days.
2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, concise messages that convey the purpose and intent of changes.
   - GitHub Copilot can assist in drafting commit messages.
3. **Regularly Sync with Main Branch**
   - Incorporate changes from the main branch into feature branches to minimize conflicts.
4. **Foster Open Communication**
   - Collaborate with teammates to resolve merge conflicts.
   - Use GitHub's integration with Microsoft Teams for seamless communication.
5. **Track Work with GitHub Issues**
   - Use Issues for tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
   - Link pull requests to relevant issues for traceability.
6. **Plan and Track with GitHub Projects**
   - Use Projects to organize and track release progress.
7. **Use Consistent Branch Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
   - Prefix feature branches with `feature/`, bug fixes with `bugfix/`, releases with `release/`, and hotfixes with `hotfix/`.
8. **Adopt Semantic Versioning for Releases**
   - Tag release branches with SemVer tags:  
     ```sh
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
     ```

### Implementing Code Review Best Practices

9. **Establish Code Review Guidelines**
   - Decide standards and expectations for reviews within your team.
10. **Use Pull Requests for Reviews**
    - Require code changes to go through PRs.
11. **Assign Appropriate Reviewers**
    - Select reviewers based on expertise and codebase knowledge.
12. **Provide Constructive Feedback**
    - Focus on quality, readability, and standards.
13. **Encourage Discussion**
    - Facilitate collaboration during code reviews.
14. **Leverage GitHub's Review Tools**
    - Use inline comments and review requests.
15. **Ensure Changes are Addressed Before Merge**
    - Only merge PRs after feedback and required changes are incorporated.
16. **Foster a Supportive Review Culture**
    - Promote positive, respectful interactions.
    - Refer to [GitHub Documentation on Pull Request Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

### Conducting Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews

17. **Review Repository Settings**
    - Periodically check settings to match org security policies.
18. **Validate Access Permissions**
    - Ensure access follows the principle of least privilege.
19. **Remove Inactive Users**
    - Revoke access for inactive/departed team members.
20. **Manage External Collaborator Access**
    - Limit their permissions to necessary scope and duration.
21. **Rotate Credentials**
    - Update access tokens and SSH keys regularly.
22. **Utilize Audit Logs**
    - Monitor repo activity for suspicious events.
23. **Automate Auditing**
    - Use tools/scripts for regular automated audits.
    - See [GitHub Audit Log Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/audit-log).

### Documenting and Sharing Knowledge Within the Dev-Team

24. **Maintain Up-to-date README Files**
    - Ensure every repo has a comprehensive, current README.
25. **Write Clear Code Comments and Documentation**
    - Use inline comments and module/class/function docs.
26. **Use Wiki/Knowledge Base**
    - Keep detailed guides, tutorials, and docs via GitHub Wiki or external platforms.
27. **Create Architecture and Design Docs**
    - Document key system components and decisions.
28. **Develop Onboarding Materials**
    - Provide guides, tutorials, and checklists for new members.
29. **Leverage Code Reviews and Pair Programming**
    - Use reviews/pairing for knowledge sharing and mentorship.
30. **Utilize Collaboration Tools**
    - Employ Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc., for ongoing knowledge sharing.
31. **Conduct Documentation Sprints (Optional)**
    - Allocate time for focused documentation updates.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Regularly review and update your processes based on feedback and lessons learned to maintain an effective workflow.
- Restrict repository and credential access following security best practices to prevent unauthorized activities.
- Documentation sprints are optional but recommended for keeping docs comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-based Development:** A workflow where most changes are merged into a single main branch to maintain a stable codebase.
- **Feature Branch:** Temporary branch for new features; merged back quickly.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Versioning format that communicates the nature and compatibility of releases (e.g., v1.0.0).
- **Pull Request (PR):** GitHub mechanism for proposing and reviewing changes before merging.
- **Code Review:** Peer review process to uphold code quality and standards.
- **Audit Log:** Record of repository and organization-level activities for security monitoring.
- **Least Privilege:** Giving users only the access they need to perform their roles, reducing risk.
- **README:** Primary documentation file in a repo (project overview, setup instructions, etc.).
- **Wiki/Knowledge Base:** Resource for broader documentation, guides, and collaborative info.
- **Documentation Sprint:** Timeboxed, focused effort by the team to update or improve documentation.
