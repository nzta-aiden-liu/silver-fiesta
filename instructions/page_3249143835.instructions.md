# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository.
- Git installed and configured.
- Team communication tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams or Slack).
- GitHub Projects, Issues, and Wiki enabled (if applicable).
- Familiarity with trunk-based development concepts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Keep Feature Branches Short-Lived**
   - Create feature branches that are merged back to the main branch within a few days.

2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Use clear messages describing the purpose and intent of changes.
   - Optionally, use GitHub Copilot to help generate commit messages.

3. **Regularly Pull Main Branch Updates**
   - Frequently merge or rebase the latest changes from the main branch into feature branches to reduce conflicts.

4. **Collaborate and Communicate**
   - Resolve merge conflicts openly with teammates.
   - Use integration tools (e.g., GitHub + Microsoft Teams) for seamless collaboration.

5. **Track Work with GitHub Issues and Projects**
   - Use Issues for tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
   - Link pull requests to related issues for traceability.
   - Plan releases with GitHub Projects.

6. **Use Branch Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase and hyphens in branch names.
   - Prefix branches as follows:
     - `feature/short-description`
     - `bugfix/short-description`
     - `release/version-number`
     - `hotfix/short-description`

7. **Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
   - Tag releases with version numbers in format: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

8. **Implement Code Review Best Practices**
   - Define clear code review guidelines.
   - Use pull requests for code reviews.
   - Assign reviewers with relevant expertise.
   - Provide constructive feedback.
   - Focus on code quality and standards.
   - Use GitHub inline comments and review requests.
   - Address all feedback before merging.
   - Foster a supportive review culture.

9. **Maintain CI/CD Standards**
   - Refer to [GitHub Actions Security Best Practices](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/).

10. **Conduct Regular Repository Audits and Access Reviews**
    - Review repository settings for compliance.
    - Regularly validate access permissions; follow least privilege.
    - Remove inactive users and limit access for external collaborators.
    - Rotate credentials (access tokens, SSH keys) as needed.
    - Use GitHub Audit Log for monitoring.
    - Utilize automated audit tools.

11. **Document and Share Knowledge Effectively**
    - Maintain updated README files with relevant project info.
    - Encourage thorough code comments/documentation.
    - Create and update Wiki or knowledge base entries.
    - Maintain architecture/design documentation.
    - Develop onboarding guides for new team members.
    - Use code reviews/pair programming for knowledge sharing.
    - Foster discussions using team communication tools.
    - Hold documentation sprints periodically to refresh documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Keeping feature branches open too long can increase merge conflict risk and delay integration.
- Access reviews and credential rotations are critical for security.
- Documentation sprints are recommended but optional depending on team/project needs.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A workflow where work branches are short-lived and changes are quickly integrated into the main branch.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning scheme using `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to communicate release compatibility.
- **Code Review**: A process for systematically reviewing changes before merging to ensure code quality and share knowledge.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Restrict users’ access and permissions to the minimum required for their role.
- **Audit Log**: A record of repository and organizational activity for monitoring and security.
- **Documentation Sprint**: A focused period devoted to updating and improving project documentation.
