# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- GitHub EMU platform access
- Familiarity with trunk-based development
- GitHub Copilot enabled (optional, for enhanced commit messages and code comments)

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches
1. **Keep feature branches short-lived**, merge them back into the main branch within a few days.
2. **Write descriptive commit messages** that clearly convey the purpose and intent of the changes. Use GitHub Copilot to assist with clarity and conciseness.
3. **Regularly incorporate changes from the main branch** into feature branches to minimize divergence and reduce merge conflicts.
4. **Foster open communication and collaborate** with teammates to resolve merge conflicts. Use GitHub’s integration with Microsoft Teams for seamless collaboration.
5. **Utilize GitHub Issues** to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests; link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.
6. **Leverage GitHub Projects** to plan and track release progress, ensuring all necessary work is completed before releases.
7. **Use branch naming conventions**:
    - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
    - Start feature branches with `feature/`, followed by a short description.
    - Start bug fix branches with `bugfix/`, followed by a short description.
    - Start release branches with `release/`, followed by the version number.
    - Start hotfix branches with `hotfix/`, followed by a brief description.
8. **Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer)** for releases. Tag release branches with:  
   `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

### Code Review Best Practices
9. **Establish clear code review guidelines** and expectations for your team.
10. **Use pull requests** as the primary code review mechanism.
11. **Assign reviewers** based on expertise and codebase familiarity.
12. **Provide constructive feedback** and suggestions for improvement.
13. **Focus on code quality, readability, and standards compliance.**
14. **Encourage open discussion and collaboration** during code review.
15. **Use GitHub code review tools**, such as inline comments and review requests.
16. **Ensure all necessary changes are addressed** before merging pull requests.
17. **Foster a positive and supportive code review culture.**
18. **Refer to GitHub Documentation on Pull Request Reviews** for more detail.

### CI/CD Standards
19. **Conduct regular repo audits and access reviews**:
    - Review repository settings and align with security policies.
    - Validate access permissions; apply least privilege principles.
    - Remove inactive or departed user access.
    - Manage external collaborators’ permissions and scope.
    - Rotate credentials such as tokens and SSH keys regularly.
    - Use GitHub’s audit log to monitor suspicious activity.
    - Consider automated auditing tools for efficiency.
20. **Refer to GitHub Documentation on Audit Logs** for more guidance.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
21. **Maintain comprehensive README files** in each repository, containing project overview, installation, usage, and other key info.
22. **Write clear and concise code comments and documentation**; use inline comments for complex logic and high-level documentation for modules and functions.
23. **Utilize GitHub Wiki or external knowledge base** for detailed guides and tutorials; encourage regular contributions and updates.
24. **Create and maintain architecture and design documents** covering system architecture, key components, and design decisions.
25. **Develop onboarding materials** (guides, checklists, tutorials) for new team members, including environment setup and coding standards.
26. **Leverage code reviews and pair programming** for knowledge sharing and mentorship.
27. **Use collaboration tools** like Slack or Microsoft Teams for ongoing team discussions and technical Q&A.
28. **Schedule documentation sprints** periodically to update and improve project documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes
- Ensure branch naming and commit messages remain consistent for traceability.
- Regularly audit access permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized repository changes.
- Documentation should be updated as projects evolve to avoid knowledge gaps.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A Git workflow where most developers work on a single branch (the trunk), with short-lived feature branches merged back quickly.
- **Release Branches**: Dedicated branches for preparing and deploying software releases.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning scheme using major, minor, and patch numbers (e.g., v1.0.0) to indicate the nature of changes.
- **Code Review**: Process where peers evaluate code for quality, maintainability, and compliance before merging.
- **Audit Log**: GitHub feature that records significant actions and repository events for security monitoring.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Software like Slack or Microsoft Teams used to enhance team communication and cooperation.
- **Documentation Sprints**: Dedicated periods for focusing on updating and improving project documentation.
