# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Access to your GitHub repositories.
- Familiarity with trunk-based development workflows.
- Understanding of basic Git and GitHub functionalities.
- Team communication tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack).

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Optimizing Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches
1. Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge back into the main branch within a few days.
2. Write descriptive commit messages that clearly convey the purpose and intent of the changes. Use GitHub Copilot for assistance.
3. Regularly incorporate changes from the main branch into feature branches to minimize conflicts.
4. Foster open communication and collaborate to resolve merge conflicts, utilizing GitHub's integration with Microsoft Teams.
5. Utilize GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests, and link pull requests to relevant issues.
6. Leverage GitHub Projects to plan and track the progress of releases.
7. Use branch naming conventions:
    - feature/ for feature branches (e.g., feature/add-login)
    - bugfix/ for bug fix branches (e.g., bugfix/header-fix)
    - release/ for release branches followed by the version number (e.g., release/1.0.0)
    - hotfix/ for urgent fixes (e.g., hotfix/critical-security)
8. Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for release versioning and tagging (e.g., v1.0.0).
9. Tag release branches with SemVer using:  
   `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

### Implementing Code Review Best Practices
1. Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations for your team.
2. Use pull requests as the primary mechanism for code reviews.
3. Assign reviewers based on expertise and familiarity with the codebase.
4. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
5. Focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to coding standards.
6. Encourage open discussion and collaboration during code reviews.
7. Use GitHub's review tools, including inline comments and review requests.
8. Ensure all necessary changes are addressed before merging.
9. Foster a positive and supportive code review culture.
10. Refer to the [GitHub Documentation on About Pull Request Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

### Conducting Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews
1. Periodically review repository settings to match security policies and best practices.
2. Review and validate individual and team access permissions following least privilege.
3. Remove access for inactive or departed team members.
4. Manage and limit access for external collaborators as needed.
5. Regularly rotate credentials, such as access tokens and SSH keys.
6. Use GitHub's audit log to monitor and investigate suspicious activities.
7. Consider automated tools or scripts for efficient auditing.
8. Refer to the [GitHub Documentation on Reviewing Your Organization's Audit Log](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations).

### Documenting and Sharing Knowledge within the Dev-Team
1. Maintain a comprehensive README file in each repository. Update regularly.
2. Encourage clear and concise code comments and documentation at all levels.
3. Utilize GitHub Wiki or external knowledge base platforms for guides and tutorials.
4. Create and maintain architecture and design documentation.
5. Develop onboarding materials for new team members (setup guides, checklists, standards).
6. Use code reviews and pair programming as knowledge-sharing opportunities.
7. Use communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for ongoing knowledge sharing.
8. Conduct documentation sprints periodically to update and improve project documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes
- Always align repository and access settings with your organization’s security policies.
- Regularly remove access for inactive users to minimize risks.
- Keep documentation up to date to facilitate onboarding and collaboration.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A source control strategy where all code changes are merged into a single main branch frequently to avoid long-lived branches.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning method using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH to communicate changes, compatibility, and maturity of releases.
- **Branch Naming Conventions**: Structured branch naming improves repository organization and clarity (e.g., feature/add-auth).
- **Code Review**: Collaborative process to examine code changes for quality, readability, and adherence to standards.
- **Audit Log**: GitHub's tool for tracking repository changes and access, useful for investigating suspicious activities.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Restrict user permissions to only those needed to fulfill their role.
- **README**: The main repository documentation file providing overview, instructions, and relevant information.
- **Documentation Sprint**: Dedicated periods where the team focuses on producing or updating documentation.
