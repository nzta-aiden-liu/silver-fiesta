# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of GitHub repositories, branches, and pull requests
- Access to a GitHub organization or repository
- Familiarity with trunk-based development concepts
- Access to collaboration tools (such as Slack or Microsoft Teams)

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Optimize Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches:**
   - Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge them back into the main branch within a few days.
   - Write descriptive commit messages to convey purpose and intent; use GitHub Copilot for assistance.
   - Regularly merge changes from the main branch into feature branches to minimize conflicts.
   - Foster open communication and collaborate to resolve merge conflicts efficiently.
   - Use GitHub Issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests; link pull requests to relevant issues for traceability.
   - Leverage GitHub Projects to plan releases and track progress.

2. **Maintain Consistent Branch Naming Conventions:**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens for branch names.
   - Start feature branches with `feature/`, followed by a brief description.
   - Start bug fix branches with `bugfix/`, followed by a brief description.
   - Start release branches with `release/`, followed by the version number.
   - Start hotfix branches with `hotfix/`, followed by a brief description.

3. **Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for Releases:**
   - Tag release branches with SemVer format, e.g., `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`.

4. **Implement Code Review Best Practices:**
   - Establish clear code review guidelines and expectations.
   - Use pull requests as the primary code review mechanism.
   - Assign reviewers based on expertise and codebase familiarity.
   - Provide constructive feedback focused on code quality and readability.
   - Use GitHub code review features (inline comments, review requests).
   - Ensure all feedback is addressed before merging pull requests.
   - Foster a positive and collaborative review culture.

5. **Conduct Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews:**
   - Review repository settings periodically for alignment with security policies.
   - Validate access permissions; adhere to the principle of least privilege.
   - Remove access for inactive or departed team members.
   - Manage permissions for external collaborators to appropriate scopes.
   - Rotate and update credentials (access tokens, SSH keys) regularly.
   - Use GitHub audit logs to monitor suspicious activity.
   - Consider automated tools/scripts for auditing.

6. **Document and Share Knowledge Within the Dev Team:**
   - Maintain comprehensive README files in each repository.
   - Encourage clear code comments and high-level documentation.
   - Use GitHub Wiki or knowledge base platforms for detailed guides and tutorials.
   - Update and maintain architecture/design documents.
   - Develop onboarding materials (guides, checklists) for new team members.
   - Use code reviews and pair programming as knowledge-sharing opportunities.
   - Utilize collaboration tools (Slack, Teams) for ongoing discussions.
   - Periodically conduct documentation sprints to keep docs up to date.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Always follow your organization’s security policies when changing repository settings or access controls.
- Remove access for inactive users immediately to minimize risks.
- Documentation should be regularly updated to avoid outdated information.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A version control strategy where all developers work on a single branch (“trunk”) and keep feature branches short-lived.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** A version numbering format that communicates compatibility and nature of software releases (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant users the permissions necessary for their job functions.
- **Audit Log:** A security tool provided by GitHub to monitor repository activity and access changes.
- **Code Review:** The process of reviewing code changes before merging them to main branches to maintain code quality and share knowledge.
- **Documentation Sprints:** Dedicated timeframes where a team focuses on updating and improving project documentation.
- **Repository Settings Review:** Periodic check of repo configuration to ensure compliance with security and operational best practices.
