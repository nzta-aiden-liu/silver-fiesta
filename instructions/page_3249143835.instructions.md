## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Keep Feature Branches Short-Lived**
   - Aim to merge feature branches back into the main branch within a few days.
2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Clearly convey the purpose and intent of changes. Use GitHub Copilot for assistance.
3. **Regularly Incorporate Changes from Main Branch**
   - Merge main branch updates into feature branches to minimize divergence and conflicts.
4. **Foster Open Communication**
   - Collaborate with teammates to resolve merge conflicts. Use Microsoft Teams integration for seamless discussion.
5. **Track Tasks with GitHub Issues**
   - Link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.
6. **Use GitHub Projects**
   - Plan and track the progress of releases; ensure all work is completed before release.
7. **Adopt Branch Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
   - Start feature branches with `feature/`, bug fix branches with `bugfix/`, release branches with `release/`, and hotfix branches with `hotfix/`.
8. **Implement Semantic Versioning**
   - Use SemVer for release versioning and tagging.
   - Tag releases using: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`
9. **Establish Code Review Guidelines**
   - Define expectations and use pull requests for code reviews.
   - Assign reviewers based on expertise.
   - Provide constructive feedback focused on quality and standards.
   - Use GitHub’s code review tools (inline comments, review requests).
   - Ensure all changes are made before merging.
10. **Conduct Regular Repository Audits**
    - Review repository settings for security and compliance.
    - Validate access permissions; adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    - Remove inactive users’ access.
    - Limit and control external collaborators’ permissions.
    - Regularly rotate repository credentials (tokens, SSH keys).
    - Use GitHub's audit log to monitor repository activity.
    - Consider automated tools for audits.
11. **Document and Share Knowledge**
    - Maintain comprehensive README files.
    - Write clear code comments and docs.
    - Use GitHub Wiki or external knowledge base for guides and tutorials.
    - Maintain architecture and design documents.
    - Develop onboarding materials (guides, checklists).
    - Promote knowledge sharing via code reviews and pair programming.
    - Use communication tools (Slack, Teams) for ongoing discussion.
    - Conduct documentation sprints to update and improve docs.

## Important Notes

- Follow branch naming and tagging conventions for consistency and organization.
- Adhere to code review standards to maintain code quality.
- Regular audits and access reviews help ensure repository security and compliance.
- Documentation and knowledge sharing foster team collaboration and maintainability.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** Development workflow where developers frequently merge small, short-lived branches into the main branch.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Versioning system using a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format to indicate compatibility and change impact.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Providing users only the access necessary for their roles.
- **GitHub Issues:** Tool for tracking bugs, tasks, and feature requests within repositories.
- **Pull Requests:** GitHub feature used to review, discuss, and approve code before merging into the main branch.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub tool for tracking repository activities and reviewing security events.
