# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites
- Access to a GitHub repository and relevant permissions (Admin/Write access recommended)
- Familiarity with Git, GitHub branching, issues, and pull requests
- Set up GitHub Copilot (optional, for commit messages and code suggestions)
- Collaboration tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack)

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development & Release Branches
1. Keep feature branches short-lived; merge back into main within a few days.
2. Write descriptive commit messages; use GitHub Copilot for clarity and conciseness.
3. Regularly merge main branch changes into feature branches to minimize divergence.
4. Use GitHub Issues for task, bug, and feature tracking. Link pull requests to relevant issues.
5. Leverage GitHub Projects to plan and track release progress.
6. Use branch naming conventions:
    - Feature branches: `feature/brief-description`
    - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/brief-description`
    - Release branches: `release/version-number`
    - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/brief-description`
7. Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for release versioning/tagging.
8. Tag release branches with SemVer:  
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   ```

### Code Review Best Practices
9. Establish and communicate clear code review guidelines for your team.
10. Use pull requests for all code reviews.
11. Assign reviewers with relevant expertise.
12. Give constructive feedback and improvement suggestions.
13. Focus reviews on code quality, readability, and standards adherence.
14. Use GitHub code review features (inline comments, review requests).
15. Ensure all review changes are addressed before merging.
16. Promote a supportive and collaborative review culture.

### CI/CD Standards
17. Refer to the latest CI/CD standards and follow recommended security practices:

### Repository Audits and Access Reviews
18. Periodically review repository settings for security and compliance.
19. Validate and adjust access permissions (principle of least privilege).
20. Remove access for inactive or departed team members.
21. Regularly review external collaborator permissions for necessary scope/duration.
22. Rotate repository credentials (tokens, SSH keys) on a regular basis.
23. Review GitHub's audit log for suspicious activities.
24. Consider using automated auditing tools/scripts for efficiency.

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
25. Maintain a comprehensive and current README in each repository.
26. Use clear, concise code-level comments and documentation.
27. Utilize GitHub Wikis or external platforms for detailed guides/tutorials.
28. Create and update architecture/design documents.
29. Prepare onboarding materials for new team members.
30. Use code reviews and pair programming for sharing knowledge and mentoring.
31. Set up communication channels (Teams/Slack) for discussions and Q&A.
32. Conduct periodic documentation sprints to keep materials up to date.

## Warnings or Important Notes
- Regularly update documentation—outdated documentation can create confusion.
- Always implement the principle of least privilege when managing access.
- Unreviewed or long-lived branches can increase merge conflicts and disrupt trunk stability.
- Ensure repository credentials are frequently rotated to minimize security risks.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A workflow where most development happens on a main branch, ensuring rapid integration.
- **Feature Branch**: A short-lived branch focused on implementing a specific feature.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning scheme (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) that communicates updates and compatibility.
- **Code Review**: The process of systematically checking new code for quality, correctness, and adherence to standards.
- **Pull Request**: A GitHub feature used to propose, discuss, and merge changes into a branch.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granting only the minimal permissions necessary to perform required actions.
- **Repository Audit**: Reviewing settings, access, and activity logs to ensure security and compliance.
- **Documentation Sprint**: A focused team activity to update or improve project documentation.
