## Step-by-step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development & Release Branch Best Practices

1. **Keep Feature Branches Short-Lived**
   - Create feature branches only when needed; aim to merge them back into main within a few days.

2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**
   - Clearly communicate the purpose of each change.
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist in generating clear and concise commit messages.

3. **Regularly Sync With Main Branch**
   - Frequently merge or rebase main into feature branches to prevent merge conflicts.

4. **Collaborate and Communicate**
   - Use GitHub discussions and integrations (e.g., Microsoft Teams) for open communication to resolve merge conflicts.

5. **Track Work with GitHub Issues**
   - Use Issues for tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
   - Link pull requests to relevant issues for traceability.

6. **Manage Releases with GitHub Projects**
   - Plan and track release progress with GitHub Projects; ensure completion before releasing.

7. **Use Consistent Branch Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase and hyphens in branch names.
   - Prefix branches appropriately:
     - `feature/` for features.
     - `bugfix/` for bug fixes.
     - `release/` for release branches, followed by the version number.
     - `hotfix/` for urgent fixes.

8. **Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
   - Use SemVer for releases and tags, e.g., `v1.0.0`.
   - Tag releases with:  
     ```
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
     ```

### Code Review Best Practices

9. **Establish Clear Review Guidelines**
   - Set clear expectations for code reviews within the team.

10. **Use Pull Requests for Reviews**
    - All code changes should go through pull requests.

11. **Assign Appropriate Reviewers**
    - Select reviewers based on expertise in relevant code areas.

12. **Provide Constructive Feedback**
    - Focus feedback on code quality, maintainability, readability, and adherence to standards.

13. **Utilize GitHub Review Tools**
    - Use inline comments, review requests, and marking changes as addressed in GitHub.

14. **Merge Only After All Issues Are Addressed**
    - Ensure all necessary changes and review comments have been resolved before merging.

### CI/CD & Security Standards

15. **Refer to Security Best Practices**
    - Follow guidance from [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/) for securing GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines.

16. **Conduct Regular Repository Audits**
    - Periodically review repository settings and access permissions.
    - Validate individual and team permissions (principle of least privilege).
    - Remove access for inactive or departed members.
    - Limit access for external collaborators.
    - Rotate credentials (tokens, SSH keys) regularly.
    - Review Audit Log activity for unusual events.
    - Consider automated auditing tools.

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

17. **Maintain Comprehensive README Files**
    - Ensure each repository’s README is detailed and up to date.

18. **Encourage Code Comments & Documentation**
    - Promote clear code comments and module/class/function documentation.

19. **Leverage Wikis and Knowledge Bases**
    - Use GitHub’s wiki or external platforms for project documentation, guides, and tutorials.

20. **Document Architecture and Designs**
    - Create architecture/design documents outlining key system components and decisions.

21. **Develop Onboarding Materials**
    - Prepare guides, checklists, and environment setup instructions for new team members.

22. **Foster Knowledge Sharing via Reviews and Pairing**
    - Use code reviews and pair programming as opportunities for mentorship and sharing insights.

23. **Facilitate Communication**
    - Use Slack, Teams, or similar tools for team discussions and technical Q&A.

24. **Conduct Documentation Sprints (Optional)**
    - Periodically allocate time to update and improve documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Always adhere to your organization’s security policies when managing repositories and access.
- Regular credential rotation and access reviews help prevent unauthorized access.
- Comprehensive documentation is essential for team collaboration and future maintainability.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A workflow centered on a single main branch; features are short-lived independently and merged back rapidly.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Systematic versioning (major.minor.patch) that communicates the compatibility and impact of software releases.
- **Pull Requests:** GitHub feature for proposing and reviewing code changes before merging into the main branch.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users should be given only permissions needed to perform their responsibilities—and no more.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub’s record of repository and organization activities, useful for monitoring security and compliance events.
- **Documentation Sprint:** A dedicated time period for focused, collaborative effort on updating and improving project documentation.
