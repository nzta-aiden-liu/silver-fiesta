# GitHub EMU Platform: Best Practices and Guidelines

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites

- Access to your organization's GitHub repositories.
- Familiarity with Git, branch management, pull requests, and basic repository permissions.
- Communication tools set up (such as Microsoft Teams or Slack) for collaboration.
- Awareness of security principles (least privilege, credential management).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches

1. Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge into the main branch within a few days.
2. Write descriptive, clear commit messages. Use GitHub Copilot for assistance when needed.
3. Regularly merge changes from the main branch into your feature branch to minimize conflicts.
4. Collaborate openly with team members to resolve merge conflicts promptly. Utilize Microsoft Teams integration if available.
5. Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Always link pull requests to relevant issues for clarity.
6. Plan and track releases using GitHub Projects to ensure all work is completed before release.
7. Follow branch naming conventions:
   - Use lowercase and hyphens.
   - Feature branches: `feature/brief-description`
   - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/brief-description`
   - Release branches: `release/version-number`
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/brief-description`
8. Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases. Tag release branches using:
   ```
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   ```
9. Refine your processes regularly based on team feedback and lessons learned.

### 2. Code Review Best Practices

1. Establish and document clear code review guidelines for your team.
2. Use pull requests for all code reviews.
3. Assign reviewers based on relevant expertise with the codebase.
4. Provide constructive and respectful feedback.
5. Focus reviews on code quality, readability, and adherence to coding standards.
6. Encourage discussion and collaboration during code review.
7. Utilize GitHub’s code review features (inline comments, review requests).
8. Ensure all required changes are addressed before merging a pull request.
9. Maintain a positive and supportive review environment.

### 3. CI/CD Standards

1. Follow security guidelines for GitHub Actions. Refer to [Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/).
2. Conduct regular audits of workflows and configurations relating to CI/CD.

### 4. Conduct Regular Repo Audits and Access Reviews

1. Periodically review repository settings for security compliance.
2. Validate access permissions, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.
3. Identify and remove access for inactive or departed members.
4. Review permissions for external collaborators; limit their access to necessary scopes and duration.
5. Rotate credentials regularly (access tokens, SSH keys) to reduce compromise risk.
6. Use GitHub audit logs to monitor for suspicious or unauthorized activity.
7. Employ automated tools to streamline audit processes and uncover potential issues.
8. Refer to [GitHub Documentation: Reviewing Your Organization's Audit Log](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/administering-your-organization/auditing/reviewing-your-organizations-audit-log).

### 5. Document and Share Knowledge within the Dev Team

1. Maintain a comprehensive README file in every repository; update as needed.
2. Encourage clear and concise inline code comments and technical documentation.
3. Use GitHub Wiki or an external knowledge base for detailed documentation, guides, and tutorials; update regularly.
4. Create and maintain architecture and design documents.
5. Develop onboarding materials with setup instructions, coding standards, and project practices.
6. Use code reviews and pair programming for mentorship and knowledge sharing.
7. Facilitate communication using tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, with dedicated channels for technical discussions.
8. Schedule documentation sprints to ensure documentation is current and thorough.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Regularly review access and credentials to prevent unauthorized repository access.
- Use only necessary permissions for collaborators and automation.
- Keep documentation and commit messages up to date for efficient onboarding and maintenance.
- Merging stale or unreviewed code can cause instability—always follow review protocols.
- Security and compliance require periodic audits and proactive monitoring.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** A workflow model where most work happens on a single main branch (trunk), with short-lived feature branches.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Versioning scheme using `major.minor.patch` notation to communicate release compatibility.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users or services.
- **Code Review:** Process where team members examine proposed changes for quality, standards adherence, and potential issues.
- **GitHub Issues and Projects:** Tools for tracking development tasks, bugs, features, and release progress.
- **Documentation Sprint:** A focused period where the team improves and updates project documentation.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub's record of access and activity for security oversight.
