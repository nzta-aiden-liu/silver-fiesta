# GitHub Copilot Instructions: Best Practices for Trunk-Based Development, Code Review, Repo Audits, and Knowledge Sharing

Source page version: 2

## Prerequisites

- An active GitHub repository.
- Permissions to create branches, pull requests, and manage repository settings.
- Familiarity with basic Git, GitHub workflows, and collaboration tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack).
- Access to GitHub Copilot (for commit messages and code completion).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches

1. **Keep feature branches short-lived.**
   - Merge them back into the main branch within a few days.
2. **Write descriptive commit messages.**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to generate clear, concise messages that convey intent.
3. **Regularly sync your feature branches with the main branch.**
   - Incorporate changes frequently to minimize divergence and conflicts.
4. **Collaborate on conflict resolution.**
   - Utilize Microsoft Teams integration to communicate with teammates.
5. **Track work using GitHub Issues.**
   - Link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.
6. **Plan releases using GitHub Projects.**
   - Track progress and ensure readiness before releasing.
7. **Use branch naming conventions:**
   - Feature branches: `feature/<brief-description>`
   - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<brief-description>`
   - Release branches: `release/<version-number>`
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<brief-description>`
   - Use lowercase and hyphens.
8. **Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.**
   - Tag format: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`
   - Tag each release branch appropriately.

### Implementing Code Review Best Practices

1. **Set clear code review guidelines for your team.**
2. **Use pull requests as the primary code review mechanism.**
3. **Assign reviewers based on expertise and codebase familiarity.**
4. **Give constructive feedback focused on quality, readability, and standards.**
5. **Foster open discussion and collaboration throughout the review.**
6. **Leverage GitHub's code review features:**
   - Inline comments, review requests, etc.
7. **Ensure all required changes are addressed before merging.**
8. **Promote a positive, supportive review culture.**
9. **Reference:** [GitHub: About Pull Request Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)

### Conducting Repository Audits and Access Reviews

1. **Review repository settings for security and compliance regularly.**
2. **Audit access permissions for individuals and teams.**
   - Apply least privilege principle.
3. **Detect and remove inactive or departed users.**
4. **Audit external collaborator permissions for scope and duration.**
5. **Rotate credentials (access tokens, SSH keys) periodically.**
6. **Utilize GitHub's audit log to monitor for suspicious activity.**
7. **Use automated tools or scripts for auditing where possible.**
8. **Reference:** [GitHub: Reviewing Your Organization's Audit Log](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/security-managing-security-for-organizations/reviewing-your-organizations-audit-log)

### Documenting and Sharing Team Knowledge

1. **Maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date README file for each repo.**
2. **Encourage clear, concise code comments and documentation.**
3. **Use GitHub Wikis or external platforms for guides, docs, and tutorials.**
   - Encourage continuous contributions and updates.
4. **Create and maintain architecture & design documents.**
5. **Develop onboarding materials (guides, checklists, tutorials).**
6. **Leverage code reviews and pair programming for knowledge sharing.**
7. **Utilize communication tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for discussions.**
   - Create technical channels or threads for sharing and questions.
8. **Periodically conduct documentation sprints to keep docs current.**

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Ensure all repository access follows security and compliance standards.
- Remove access for inactive users to mitigate unauthorized actions.
- Rotate credentials regularly to prevent compromise.
- Make documentation updates a regularly scheduled team activity.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development:** Development approach where feature branches are short-lived and frequently merged into the main branch.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** A standardized versioning format (major.minor.patch) that communicates compatibility and changes.
- **Pull Request (PR):** GitHub's workflow for reviewing and merging code changes collaboratively.
- **Code Review:** The process of critically examining code to improve quality and maintainability.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Restricting user permissions to the minimum required to perform their role.
- **Audit Log:** GitHub's tool for recording and monitoring repository actions for security and compliance.
- **Documentation Sprint:** Allocating dedicated time for updating and improving project documentation.
