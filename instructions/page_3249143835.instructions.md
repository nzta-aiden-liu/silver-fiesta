# Best Practices

Source page version: 3

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Git, GitHub workflows, and repository management.
- Access to a GitHub repository with permissions to create branches, issues, pull requests, and update documentation.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Feature Branch Management**
    - Keep feature branches short-lived; aim to merge to the main branch within a few days.
    - Regularly incorporate changes from the main branch into feature branches to reduce conflicts.

2. **Commit Message Writing**
    - Write descriptive and clear commit messages.  
    - Use GitHub Copilot to help write concise commit messages.

3. **Collaboration and Conflict Resolution**
    - Foster open communication and collaborate closely with teammates to resolve merge conflicts.
    - Utilize GitHub's integration with Microsoft Teams for seamless collaboration.

4. **Task and Issue Tracking**
    - Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
    - Link pull requests to relevant issues for context and traceability.

5. **Project Planning**
    - Leverage GitHub Projects to plan and track release progress.
    - Ensure all required work is completed before releasing.

6. **Branch Naming Conventions**
    - Use lowercase letters and hyphens for branch names.
    - Prefix branches as follows:
        - Feature branches: `feature/short-description`
        - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/short-description`
        - Release branches: `release/version-number`
        - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/short-description`

7. **Release Versioning**
    - Adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.
    - Tag releases using:  
      `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`

8. **Code Review Best Practices**
    - Establish clear guidelines and expectations.
    - Use pull requests as the primary method for code reviews.
    - Assign reviewers with appropriate expertise.
    - Provide constructive, actionable feedback.
    - Emphasize code quality, readability, and standards compliance.
    - Use GitHub features like inline comments and review requests.
    - Ensure all required changes are addressed before merging.
    - Foster a positive, supportive review culture.

    _See [GitHub Documentation: About Pull Request Reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)_

9. **CI/CD Standards**
    - Follow best practices for continuous integration and deployment.
    - Refer to [GitHub Security Lab: Preventing Pwn Requests in Actions](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)

10. **Repository Audits and Access Reviews**
    - Periodically review repository settings for alignment with security policies.
    - Review and validate user and team access permissions, adhering to least privilege.
    - Remove inactive or departed team members.
    - Review external collaborators and limit their access scope.
    - Rotate credentials like tokens and SSH keys regularly.
    - Monitor the GitHub audit log for suspicious events.
    - Use automated tools or scripts to streamline audits.

11. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
    - Maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date README for each repository.
    - Write clear code comments and documentation for modules, classes, and functions.
    - Use GitHub Wiki or external platforms for detailed guides and tutorials.
    - Create and maintain system architecture and design documents.
    - Develop onboarding materials for new team members, including setup guides and standards.
    - Utilize code reviews and pair programming for knowledge sharing.
    - Use collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams for ongoing discussions.
    - Conduct periodic documentation sprints to update and improve project documentation.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Continuously refine best practices based on team feedback and lessons learned.
- Ensure documentation remains current and comprehensive as projects evolve.
- Review and enforce security standards regularly for repository safety and compliance.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-based Development**: A source control workflow where feature branches are kept short-lived and merged quickly to the main branch.
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: A versioning convention (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) that communicates release compatibility.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Restricting user access rights to the bare minimum needed for their responsibilities.
- **Code Review**: The process of systematically examining code changes by team members to ensure quality, maintainability, and knowledge sharing.
- **Repository Audit**: Regular evaluation of repository settings, permissions, and access to uphold security and compliance.
- **Documentation Sprint**: A focused period where the development team dedicates time to update and improve documentation.
