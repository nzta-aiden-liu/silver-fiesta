# (GitHub-Start) Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository with necessary permissions.
- Understanding of Git and branch operations.
- CI/CD pipeline setup for status checks.
- Familiarity with GitHub Pull Requests, Releases, and Branch Protection Rules.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Utilize the main branch as the source of truth**  
   - Ensure the main branch is always stable and in a deployable state.

2. **Create feature branches for new work**  
   - Branch from main for new features or bug fixes.
   - Name branches descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).

3. **Create specialty branches as needed**  
   - Use branches like `test/*` and `performance/*` for specialized workflows.

4. **Submit pull requests for all changes**  
   - Open a pull request to merge feature or specialty branches into main.
   - Use GitHub's Pull Request system for collaboration and discussion.

5. **Perform code reviews on pull requests**  
   - Reviewers provide feedback and approve changes before merging.
   - Address all comments and suggestions.

6. **Merge approved pull requests using merge commits**  
   - Merge the feature branch into main with a merge commit to preserve history.

7. **Create release branches for deployment**  
   - Branch from main for each release, naming as `release/x.y.z`.
   - Use this branch for final stabilization and testing.

8. **Stabilize release branches**  
   - Only apply bug fixes, performance improvements, and test changes.

9. **Tag and create releases in GitHub**  
   - After stabilization, create a GitHub release with proper version, notes, and artifacts.

10. **Use artifact attestations (optional)**  
    - Enable artifact attestations to verify build origin and strengthen supply chain security.

11. **Enforce branch protection rules**  
    - Require pull request reviews before merging.
    - Require status checks (tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis) on pull requests.
    - Restrict push access on main and release branches to dedicated teams or individuals.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- **Do not introduce new features on release branches**: Make only bug fixes and performance optimizations to preserve stability.
- **Restrict direct pushes on protected branches**: Only allow merges via pull requests by authorized users.
- **All code changes must be reviewed**: This maintains quality and consistency.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A development strategy where all changes branch from and merge back to a single shared branch (main/trunk).
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived branches created for individual features or bug fixes.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: A mechanism for merging changes, enabling code review and discussion before integration.
- **Release Branches**: Dedicated branches representing stable snapshots for each release version.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: GitHub settings to prevent unauthorized changes and enforce workflow standards.
- **Artifact Attestations**: Metadata proving how and where build artifacts were created, enhancing software supply chain security.
