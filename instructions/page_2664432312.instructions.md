# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites
- Access to the repository on GitHub with appropriate permissions.
- Familiarity with GitHub workflows, branches, and pull requests.
- Continuous Integration (CI) enabled for automated checks.
- Knowledge of release management and semantic versioning.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Main Branch Management**
   - Ensure the `main` branch is always stable and deployable.
   - Protect the `main` branch using branch protection rules.

2. **Creating Feature or Bugfix Branches**
   - For new features or bug fixes, create a dedicated branch from `main`.  
     Example naming: `feature/add-user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.

3. **Specialty Branches (Optional)**
   - Create specialty branches as needed, such as `test/*` or `performance/*`.

4. **Develop and Commit**
   - Work on your assigned feature or bugfix branch.
   - Keep commits focused and descriptive.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Open a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
   - Use clear titles and descriptions for your PRs.

6. **Code Review**
   - Request one or more reviewers to review your pull request.
   - Address feedback and suggestions from reviewers.

7. **Merge to Main**
   - Once approved and all discussions are resolved, merge the PR using a merge commit.

8. **Creating a Release Branch**
   - When preparing for a release, create a branch from `main`, e.g. `release/1.0.0`.
   - Use semantic versioning conventions for naming.

9. **Stabilizing the Release Branch**
   - Focus on bug fixes, performance improvements, and final testing in the release branch.
   - Do not introduce new features on the release branch.

10. **Release Deployment**
    - When stable, create a GitHub release from the release branch.
    - Add release notes, version tag, and any required artifacts.

11. **Artifact Attestations (Recommended)**
    - Consider using artifact attestations to secure your supply chain by recording where/how the build was created.

12. **Enforce Branch Protection Rules**
    - Set up the following protections on `main` and release branches:
      - Require pull request review before merging.
      - Require all status checks (tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis) to pass before merging.
      - Restrict direct push access to authorized individuals or teams only.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Never push directly to the `main` or release branches—always use pull requests.
- Only bug fixes and stabilization work should happen on release branches.
- New features must only be added via feature branches from `main`.
- Ensure all required status checks pass before merging any pull request.

## Key Concepts

- **Main Branch:** Central source of truth; always deployable and protected.
- **Feature/Bugfix Branch:** Dedicated branches for developing new features or fixing bugs, branched off `main`.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge changes from a branch into `main` (or another branch), allowing for code review and automated checks.
- **Release Branch:** A branch created from `main` to prepare and stabilize a release; no new features should be added here.
- **Branch Protection:** GitHub settings to enforce code review, status checks, and restrict direct pushes, ensuring stable and secure codebase management.
- **Artifact Attestation:** Security practice to record build provenance for supply chain integrity.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Versioning convention (e.g., `1.0.0`) to track releases and updates systematically.
