# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites
- Access to a GitHub repository with the ability to create branches and pull requests.
- CI/CD pipeline integrated with GitHub for status checks.
- Defined list of individuals or teams with push access to protected branches.
- Understanding of GitHub release documentation and workflows.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Keep the Main Branch Stable**
   - Treat the main branch as the central source of truth.
   - Ensure it is always deployable and stable.

2. **Create Feature and Bugfix Branches**
   - Start each new feature or bug fix from the main branch.
   - Use clear, descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).
   
3. **Create Specialty Branches (If Applicable)**
   - Use specialty branch prefixes (e.g., `test/*`, `performance/*`) as needed for specific purposes.

4. **Use Pull Requests for Changes**
   - Submit a pull request when work on a branch is complete.
   - Use pull requests to facilitate collaboration and code review.

5. **Conduct Code Reviews**
   - Reviewers provide feedback and suggestions.
   - Use GitHub's code review tools to manage the process.

6. **Merge Changes to Main Branch**
   - Only merge pull requests after approval and resolution of all comments.
   - Use merge commits to preserve a clear code history.

7. **Create Release Branches**
   - When ready for a release, create a release branch from main (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
   - This branch becomes the stable snapshot for the release.

8. **Stabilize the Release Branch**
   - Perform bug fixes, optimizations, and final testing on the release branch.
   - Do not introduce new features.

9. **Tag and Publish a GitHub Release**
   - When the release branch is stable, create a GitHub release.
   - Add version, release notes, and relevant artifacts.
   - Tag the release for future reference.

10. **Implement Branch Protection Rules**
    - Require pull request reviews before merging into main or release branches.
    - Require all status checks (tests, static analysis, SBOM, CodeQL) to pass before merging.
    - Restrict who can push directly to main and release branches.

11. **Consider Artifact Attestations**
    - Use artifact attestations to track and secure where/how the software was built for supply chain integrity.

## Warnings or Important Notes
- Do not push directly to protected branches (main or release); always use pull requests.
- Do not introduce new features directly on a release branch; use only for stabilization and bug fixes.
- Failure to adhere to branch protection rules may compromise codebase stability and security.

## Key Concepts

- **Main Branch:** The stable, deployable source of truth for the repository.
- **Feature/Bugfix Branch:** Temporary branches for isolated development of features or bug fixes.
- **Release Branch:** A branch created from main for finalizing and deploying a specific release version.
- **Pull Request:** GitHub’s mechanism to propose, discuss, and review changes before merging.
- **Code Review:** The collaborative process of reviewing proposed changes for quality and correctness.
- **Branch Protection Rules:** GitHub settings to enforce review, testing, and access controls for key branches.
- **Artifact Attestations:** Digital statements about the provenance and integrity of build artifacts.
- **Status Checks:** Automated tests and analyses (CI/CD) required to pass before merging code.
