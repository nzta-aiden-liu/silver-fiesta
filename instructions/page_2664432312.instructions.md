# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Access to the repository on GitHub.
- Basic understanding of Git, GitHub interface, and branching.
- Integrated CI/CD pipeline (recommended for status checks).

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Main Branch Management**
    - Ensure the `main` branch is always in a deployable and stable state.
2. **Creating Feature Branches**
    - Start new features or bug fixes by creating a branch from `main`.
    - Name branches descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.
3. **Creating Specialty Branches**
    - Create specialty branches with clear prefixes, e.g., `test/*` or `performance/*`, as needed.
4. **Working on Branches**
    - Commit and push focused, single-purpose changes to your branch.
5. **Submitting Pull Requests**
    - Submit a pull request (PR) to request merging changes back to the `main` branch.
    - Use GitHub's PR features for collaboration, review, and discussion.
6. **Conducting Code Reviews**
    - Collaborators must review and approve the pull request before merging.
    - Address all feedback and resolve discussions.
7. **Merging Approved Changes**
    - Merge changes via a merge commit to preserve history and traceability.
8. **Creating Release Branches**
    - Before releases, create a branch from `main`, e.g., `release/1.0.0`, for stabilization.
9. **Stabilizing Release Branch**
    - Focus solely on bug fixes, performance optimizations, and testing.
    - Do not introduce new features on release branches.
10. **Publishing Releases**
    - Once stable, create a GitHub release, add release notes and artifacts, and tag for reference.
    - Consider using artifact attestations for supply chain security.
11. **Applying Branch Protection Rules**
    - Require pull request reviews before any merge to `main` or release branches.
    - Enforce passing status checks via CI/CD (e.g., tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis).
    - Restrict direct push access to `main` and release branches to authorized users or teams.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Direct pushes to the `main` or release branches should be strictly limited to prevent destabilization.
- Ensure all status checks pass before merging; failures should block merges to protected branches.
- Always use merge commits for PR merges to maintain a clear history.
- Do not add features to release branches; only stabilization work is allowed.

## Key Concepts

- **Main Branch:** Central, stable, deployable branch serving as the source of truth.
- **Feature Branch:** Temporary branch for new features/bugfixes, branched from `main`.
- **Specialty Branch:** Task-specific branches, e.g., `test/*`, `performance/*`.
- **Pull Request (PR):** Mechanism for collaborating, reviewing, and merging changes.
- **Code Review:** Process for validating code quality and fostering shared understanding.
- **Release Branch:** Stabilization branch for a specific release version, e.g., `release/1.0.0`.
- **Branch Protection Rules:** GitHub settings to enforce reviews, status checks, and restrict direct access.
- **Artifact Attestation:** Security practice for verifying build sources and integrity.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Versioning scheme using format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
