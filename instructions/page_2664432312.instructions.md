# Efficient Collaboration Using Trunk-Based Development with Release Branches on GitHub

Source page version: 15

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository is created and accessible.
- Familiarity with basic Git operations (branching, pull requests, code review).
- CI/CD pipeline is set up for automated testing and validation.
- Team has permissions set for branch protection and access control.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone and Work from the Main Branch**  
   - Ensure the `main` branch is stable and always deployable.
   - Clone the repository and checkout the `main` branch for new development.

2. **Create a Feature or Bugfix Branch**  
   - For each new feature or bug fix, create a dedicated branch from `main`.
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).

3. **Implement Feature or Fix**  
   - Focus work on the branch for a single purpose.
   - Commit changes locally as development progresses.

4. **Push Changes and Open a Pull Request**  
   - Push your feature/bugfix branch to the remote repository.
   - Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to `main`.

5. **Conduct Code Review**  
   - Have designated reviewers inspect the PR for quality and correctness.
   - Use GitHub’s review features to provide feedback, request changes, and approve.

6. **Merge to Main Branch**  
   - After approval and successful resolution of reviewer comments, merge the PR using a merge commit (preserves history).
   - Ensure all status checks pass before merging.

7. **Create a Release Branch**  
   - When ready for a release, create a branch from `main` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
   - Use semantic versioning in release branch naming.

8. **Stabilize the Release Branch**  
   - Focus on bug fixes, optimizations, and final testing.
   - Do not introduce new features on the release branch.

9. **Publish a Release**  
   - When ready, create a GitHub release from the release branch.
   - Tag the release, write release notes, and attach any necessary artifacts.

10. **Enable Artifact Attestations** (Optional)  
    - Use artifact attestations to record where and how builds are produced for supply chain security.

11. **Enforce Branch Protection Rules**  
    - Require pull request reviews before merging to `main` or release branches.
    - Require status checks (tests, static analysis, CodeQL, SBOM) to pass before merging.
    - Restrict push access for `main` and release branches to authorized individuals or teams.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- **Direct pushes to `main` or release branches are prohibited; all changes must go through pull requests.**
- **All status checks must pass before merging.**
- **Do not add new features in release branches; only stabilization changes are permitted.**

## Key Concepts

- **Main Branch**: The central, always-deployable branch of your codebase.
- **Feature/Bugfix Branches**: Short-lived branches for focused work derived from `main`.
- **Release Branches**: Branches prepared for production deployment; only stabilized code allowed.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge changes from a branch into another, with review and discussion.
- **Code Review**: Validation of code quality and correctness by peers before merging.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: GitHub settings that enforce reviews, status checks, and limited write access.
- **Status Checks**: Automated validations (tests, analysis) that must pass before merging.
- **Artifact Attestations**: Mechanisms to prove how/where build artifacts were created, increasing supply chain security.
