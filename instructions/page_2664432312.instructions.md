# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository with administrative privileges.
- Understanding of Git version control basics.
- Familiarity with GitHub features: branches, pull requests, code review, releases.
- CI/CD pipeline integration configured (recommended).

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Establish main branch**
   - Ensure the `main` branch is stable and always deployable.
   - Maintain the `main` branch as the single source of truth.

2. **Create feature branches**
   - For each new feature or bugfix, create a branch from `main`.
   - Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).

3. **Create specialty branches (optional)**
   - For testing or performance tasks, create branches like `test/*` or `performance/*`.

4. **Develop on feature branch**
   - Make focused changes related only to the feature or fix on your branch.

5. **Submit pull request**
   - Open a pull request targeting `main`.
   - Provide a clear summary and ensure code complies with contribution guidelines.

6. **Undergo code review**
   - Collaborate with team members to review your pull request.
   - Address any feedback or required changes.

7. **Merge to main**
   - After approval and resolved discussions, merge via a merge commit for traceability.

8. **Create release branch**
   - For upcoming releases, create a branch from `main` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
   - Use this branch to prepare the stable release.

9. **Stabilization on release branch**
   - Perform bug fixes, optimizations, and final testing.
   - Avoid introducing new features; focus on stability.

10. **Tag and publish release**
    - Create and tag a GitHub release with relevant notes and artifacts.
    - Use semantic versioning for easy reference.

11. **Implement branch protection rules**
    - Require pull request reviews for `main` and release branches.
    - Ensure all status checks (tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis) pass before merging.
    - Restrict direct push access to authorized individuals or teams.

12. **Artifact attestations**
    - Consider using artifact attestations to strengthen software supply chain security.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Do not push directly to `main` or release branches; always use pull requests.
- Avoid introducing new features on release branches.
- Ensure all automated checks pass before merging.
- Only authorized users should have push access to protected branches.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-Based Development**: A branching strategy where most work happens off short-lived branches from the main branch, promoting continuous integration.
- **Main Branch**: The principal branch with always-deployable code.
- **Feature Branch**: A branch for each new feature or bug, merged back after completion.
- **Release Branch**: A branch created from `main` when preparing for a release, dedicated to stabilization.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A GitHub feature for code review and merging proposed changes.
- **Code Review**: The process where team members verify and suggest improvements before merging code.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Settings that enforce collaborative best practices and prevent unintended changes.
- **Status Checks**: Automated tests or quality gates that must pass before pull requests can be merged.
- **Artifact Attestations**: Metadata that attests to how and where software artifacts are built, improving supply chain trust.
- **Semantic Versioning**: The use of version numbers (e.g., 1.0.0) to indicate release versions.
