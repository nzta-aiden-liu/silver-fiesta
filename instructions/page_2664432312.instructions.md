# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with GitHub repositories and branching.
- Permissions to create branches and pull requests.
- Access to CI/CD pipeline and code review tools.
- Understanding of GitHub branch protection rules.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Main Branch Management**
   - Treat the main branch as the central source of truth.
   - Keep the main branch in a deployable, highly stable state.
   
2. **Create Feature Branches**
   - For new features or bug fixes, create a dedicated branch from main.
   - Name branches descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).
   
3. **Specialty Branch Usage**
   - For specialized tasks, use dedicated branches such as `test/*`, `performance/*` (details must be documented by your team).
   
4. **Submit Pull Requests**
   - When your work on a feature branch is complete, open a pull request to merge changes into main.
   - Use clear titles and provide relevant context in the pull request description.
   
5. **Conduct Code Review**
   - Collaborate with team members to review all pull requests.
   - Address feedback and ensure code quality standards are met.
   
6. **Merge to Main**
   - Once approved and discussion is resolved, merge pull requests into main using a merge commit for traceability.
   
7. **Create Release Branches**
   - When preparing for a release, create a branch from main (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
   - Use this branch as a stable snapshot for release-specific fixes and testing.
   
8. **Stabilize Release Branch**
   - Focus on bug fixes, performance optimizations, and final testing.
   - Do not introduce new features in release branches.
   
9. **Publish a Release**
   - When stable, create a formal GitHub release with a version tag, release notes, and artifacts.
   - Use GitHub’s release functionality for visibility and version traceability.
   
10. **Enable Attestations (Optional)**
    - Use artifact attestations to enhance supply chain security of your builds.
  
11. **Configure Branch Protection**
    - Require pull request reviews before allowing merges.
    - Require status checks (tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis) to pass before allowing merges.
    - Restrict direct push access to main and release branches to designated personnel only.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- **Never push directly to main or release branches.** Always use pull requests and obtain code reviews.
- **Do not add new features to release branches.** Only stabilization and fixes are allowed.
- **Enforce branch protection rules** to maintain codebase integrity and security.

## Key Concepts

- **Main Branch:** The primary, deployable branch of your repository.
- **Feature Branch:** Temporary branch for developing new features or bug fixes.
- **Release Branch:** Branch taken from main to prepare for a release; only bug fixes and stabilization changes are allowed.
- **Pull Request:** Proposal to merge changes from a branch into main, allowing for review and discussion.
- **Code Review:** Process where peers evaluate proposed changes for quality and correctness.
- **Branch Protection Rules:** GitHub settings to control how changes are merged into critical branches.
- **Status Checks:** Automated tests and analyses run on pull requests to ensure code quality.
- **Attestations:** Security evidence indicating how and where builds originate, protecting the supply chain.
