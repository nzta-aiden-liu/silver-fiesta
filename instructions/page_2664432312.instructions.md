# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository.
- Understanding of basic Git and GitHub operations.
- Familiarity with your team's code of conduct and contribution guidelines.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Ensure the main branch is stable and always deployable.**
   - Maintain code quality and stability on the main branch.
2. **Create feature branches for new work.**
   - Branch from `main` for each new feature or bug fix.
   - Use clear, descriptive naming conventions (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).
3. **Optionally, create specialty branches for specific tasks.**
   - Use naming such as `test/*` or `performance/*` as required.
4. **Collaborate and submit changes via pull requests.**
   - Push your completed work to a feature branch.
   - Open a pull request to merge changes back to `main`.
   - Use pull requests to facilitate code review and team discussion.
5. **Conduct code reviews.**
   - Colleagues must review your pull request.
   - Leverage GitHub's code review features for feedback and improvements.
6. **Merge approved pull requests into main.**
   - Only merge after approval and resolution of discussions.
   - Use merge commits to preserve history.
7. **Create a release branch when preparing for a new release.**
   - Branch from `main` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`).
   - Use the release branch as the basis for release stabilization.
8. **Stabilize the release branch.**
   - Focus on bug fixes, performance enhancements, and final testing.
   - Do not add new features; prioritize stability.
9. **Create and tag a GitHub release when ready to deploy.**
   - Generate release notes, artifacts, and tag the release for versioning.
10. **Consider artifact attestations for supply chain security.**
    - Use artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds.
11. **Implement branch protection rules.**
    - Require pull request reviews before merging into protected branches.
    - Require status checks (tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis) to pass before merging.
    - Restrict push access to protected branches to authorized users/teams.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Direct pushes to `main` or release branches should be strictly limited to prevent destabilizing the codebase.
- Never introduce new features on a release branch once it’s cut; only accept changes that improve stability.

## Key Concepts

- **Trunk-based Development:** A workflow where the main branch (trunk) is the central point, and branches are short-lived.
- **Release Branch:** A branch off the main branch dedicated to stabilizing, testing, and deploying a specific release version.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A GitHub feature for merging code, supporting collaboration and code review before integration.
- **Branch Protection Rules:** GitHub settings to enforce safety, requiring reviews and status checks before merging, and restrict push access.
- **Artifact Attestation:** Metadata that provides proof of how and where software artifacts were built, strengthening supply chain security.
