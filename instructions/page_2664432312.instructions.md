# Branching Strategy

Source page version: 16

## Prerequisites

- Access to a GitHub repository.
- Familiarity with GitHub branching, pull requests, and code review.
- CI/CD pipeline configured for status checks.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. **Start with the main branch**
   - Use the main branch as the central, stable source of truth. Always keep it deployable.

2. **Create a feature or bugfix branch**
   - Branch from main for new features or bug fixes.
   - Name branches descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.

3. **Work on specialty branches as needed**
   - Examples include `test/*` or `performance/*`.
   - Document their usage as required.

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Open a pull request when work on a feature branch is complete.
   - Engage in code review and collaboration through GitHub’s pull request interface.

5. **Participate in code review**
   - Reviewers provide feedback and suggestions.
   - Use GitHub’s code review features to streamline improvements and discussions.

6. **Merge to main**
   - After code review approval and resolution of discussions, merge using a merge commit for traceability.

7. **Create a release branch**
   - When preparing a release, branch from main (e.g., `release/1.0.0`) to create a release branch.

8. **Stabilize the release branch**
   - Perform fixes, optimizations, and final testing.
   - Avoid introducing new features; focus on stability.

9. **Create a GitHub release**
   - When ready, publish a release specifying version, release notes, and tags.
   - Attach relevant artifacts for reference and versioning.

10. **Consider artifact attestations**
    - Implement artifact attestations to enhance supply chain security.

11. **Set branch protection rules**
    - Require pull request reviews before merging.
    - Require all CI/CD status checks to pass (e.g., tests, CodeQL, SBOM, static analysis).
    - Restrict direct push access to main and release branches.

## Warnings or Important Notes

- Never push directly to the main or release branches—always use pull requests.
- Only approved reviewers should merge changes.
- Ensure all status checks pass before merging to main or release branches.

## Key Concepts

- **Main branch:** Primary branch; always deployable and stable.
- **Feature/bugfix branch:** Temporary branch for new features or fixes, branched off main.
- **Specialty branch:** Branches for specific purposes (e.g. testing, performance).
- **Pull request:** Mechanism for code review and discussion prior to merging changes.
- **Code review:** Process where peers evaluate, comment on, and approve changes.
- **Release branch:** Stable branch for preparing and finalizing a specific release.
- **Branch protection rules:** GitHub settings enforcing code review, status checks, and restricted access for critical branches.
- **Artifact attestation:** Documentation providing details about the build origin and process to strengthen security.
- **Status checks:** Automated validations such as tests, code analysis, and vulnerability scans run during CI/CD.

Refer to GitHub documentation for detailed guidance on branches, pull requests, protected branches, releases, and workflow best practices.
